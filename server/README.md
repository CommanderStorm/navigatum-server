# Server

Our server is architected as a single monolith (with low coupling, chill).
The reason behind this is that we are a very small team (=not multiple ones, mostly singe devs) and limt ourselves to the necessary components.

Please see the [main-api](/server/main-api) for the main API server, which serves the API endpoints
